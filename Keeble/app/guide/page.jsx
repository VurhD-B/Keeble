                The Build page helps you make your own mechanical keyboard using parts recommended by us! 
                The page takes you through a bunch of steps that one could take to make their own mechanical keyboard.<br />
                On the left side, is a list of products by parts. With the help of our filters, 
                select one of your liking, and it will be added to the Assembly Area on the right side.<br />
                This is repeated for the remaining main parts, after which you can see the mechanical keyboard you created in the Assembly Area! 
                After which, you may also add optional accessories to your build.<br />
                If you like your creation, you can save it as a favorite build, which will be displayed in your profile for everyone to see.
